# Andreas Meier from Andreas Meier "Ich"
"Ich" is an autobiographic novel from Andreas Maier. So Andreas Meier is the
main character of this novel. I found it very impressive how he tells us in 
this novel how he refuses to go to the kindergarden after his very first day there.

As the autor says (in German language):
> Ich, diese drei Buchstaben, sind der Mittelteil des Wortes Nichts
