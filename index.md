# Andreas Meier from Andreas Meier "Ich"
"Ich" is a autobiographic novel from Andreas Maier. So Andreas Meier is the
main character of this novel. I found it very impressive how he tell us in 
this novel how he refuses to go to the kindergarden after his very first day there.

## character traits of the narrator
* does not want to go to kindergarden
* feels to be other than other children
* loves reading books

As the autor says (in German language):
> Ich, diese drei Buchstaben, sind der Mittelteil des Wortes Nichts
